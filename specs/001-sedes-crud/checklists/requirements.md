**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit-plan`.

Key assumptions to revisit before implementation:
- The cross-module "active operations" validation (FR-006 advanced) is deferred to Stage 2/3.
